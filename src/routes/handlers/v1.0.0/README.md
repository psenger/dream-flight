# v1.0.0

This App assumes the API will have to support and serve multiple versions. To do this, ``Accept-Version`` header can be 
specified by the client. If none is spcified, then the application default will be used.
 
Versions will respect [semver](http://semver.org/) convention.

The files in this directory are certified to work with API version 1.0.0 of the ``/fligts`` api
